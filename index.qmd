## About: 

Hi, I'm Alyssa, a senior at UCLA studying Statistics and Data Science with a minor in entrepreneurship. I'm passionate about the intersection between data science and thinking outside the box. I had the opportunity to intern at FTI consulting and will be returning September 2025 in the Data and Analytics field within the Forensic and Litigation segment. I currently work at a startup, helping the founders grow their platform and perform market research. 

In my free time, I teach yoga, love to travel, and attend concerts!
